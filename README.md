# VoiceBot

Having a bluetooth keyboard, my goal was to replace my mouse by just my voice so that I could work on my computer without having to just sit on my chair all day. Zero is a desktop voice bot that allows repetitive browser tasks to be done by just your voice. It was coded using the sphinx4 library in java and uses selenium webdriver and javascript for window and browser manipulation.
